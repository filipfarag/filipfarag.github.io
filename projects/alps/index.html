					<p>Travellers from all across the world come to the Alps, to leave behind their worries, escape the stress of everyday life and be at one with nature. With 82 peaks over 4,000 metres, hundreds of peaks over 3,000 metres, hundreds of glaciers along the main ridge, lush green meadows and charming huts, the Alps boast a truly unique landscape.</p><br>

					<p>wrote Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, German writer and statesman, about the Tyrolean Alps in 1829. We can relate.</p>

						<h4>National Park</h4>
						<p>The only National Park in the German Alps with its varied landscapes and breathtaking beauty is to be found in the Berchtesgadener Land. Here visitors can experience nature, learn about environmental protection while exploring this unspoiled reserve on well-marked hiking trails. Ever since its foundation in 1978, Germany's only alpine National Park has been a place where plants and wildlife remain untouched. In this way we can preserve a piece of our past for future generations.</p>

						<h4>Watzmann</h4>
						<p>The Watzmann mountain (2,713m) is the superstar of the Berchtesgaden Alps as it towers above the valleys below. Its eastern face is a sheer climb of close to 2,000 meters and can only be scaled by experts. However, good hikers can reach the summit via another trail that leads past a large overnight hut called Watzmannhaus. Even for those who do not scale Germany's second-highest peak, a photo of the Watzmann is a must for every visitor to Berchtesgaden.</p>

						<p>Lake Königssee with its emerald green color and nestled at the foot of the imposing eastern wall of Mount Watzmann in the heart of the Berchtesgaden National Park is one of nature's true masterpieces.</p>
