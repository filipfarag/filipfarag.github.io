					<p>Travellers from all across the world come to the Alps, to leave behind their worries, escape the stress of everyday life and be at one with nature. With 82 peaks over 4,000 metres, hundreds of peaks over 3,000 metres, hundreds of glaciers along the main ridge, lush green meadows and charming huts, the Alps boast a truly unique landscape.</p><br>

						<h4>National Park</h4>
						<p>The only National Park in the German Alps with its varied landscapes and breathtaking beauty is to be found in the Berchtesgadener Land. Here visitors can experience nature, learn about environmental protection while exploring this unspoiled reserve on well-marked hiking trails. Ever since its foundation in 1978, Germany's only alpine National Park has been a place where plants and wildlife remain untouched. In this way we can preserve a piece of our past for future generations.</p>

						<h4>Watzmann</h4>
						<p>The Watzmann mountain (2,713m) is the superstar of the Berchtesgaden Alps as it towers above the valleys below. Its eastern face is a sheer climb of close to 2,000 meters and can only be scaled by experts. However, good hikers can reach the summit via another trail that leads past a large overnight hut called Watzmannhaus. Even for those who do not scale Germany's second-highest peak, a photo of the Watzmann is a must for every visitor to Berchtesgaden.</p>

						<h4>Eiskapelle</h4>
						<p>At the foot of Watzmann Mountain on the eastern wall is the awe-inspiring Ice Chapel. The Eiskapelle may well be the lowest lying permanent snowfield in the Alps. Its lower end is only 930 metres high in the upper Eisbach valley and is about an hour's walk from St. Bartholom√§ on the K√∂nigssee. Unfortunately entering this cave is extremely dangerous, as the ice is disintegrating all the time, every year careless visitors are hurt or even killed by falling ice.</p>

						<h4>K√∂nigssee</h4>
						<p>Lake K√∂nigssee with its emerald green color and nestled at the foot of the imposing eastern wall of Mount Watzmann in the heart of the Berchtesgaden National Park is one of nature's true masterpieces. The 8 km-long lake boasts a water clear as glass. K√∂nigssee is the cleanest lake in Germany. For this reason, only electric-powered passenger ships, rowing, and pedal boats have been permitted on the lake since 1909.</p>

					<p>Whether connoisseur, active or adventurous, everyone is thrilled by the Italian Dolomites. Little wonder, with the variety offered in the Dolomites holiday region: the majestic Dolomite mountain peaks, and excellent cuisine, a colourful mix of down-to-earth fare and Italian specialties, and of course the warm welcome that meets you wherever you go.</p>

						<h4>Lago di <s>Instagram</s> Braies</h4>
						<p>Lago di Braies is one of the most beautiful lakes in Italy. Located at an altitude of about 1,500 m above sea level in the picturesque Alta Pusteria valley, the mountain lake captivates with its turquoise-green colour and the imposing Seekofel massif (2,810 m) that surrounds it. The lake, with an average depth of 17 m, measures 36 m at its lowest point. Even though Lago di Braies is listed amongst the bathing lakes of South Tyrol, only a few hardy people dare to jump into the cool waters.</p>

						<h4>Marmolada</h4>
						<p>The Marmolada glacier is certainly one of the most majestic mountains to admire. With its 3,342m of height and its eternal snow, it is also called the "Queen of the Dolomites". Marmolada offers on the Punta Rocca peak a panoramic terrace with a 360 ¬∞ view of the mountain world of the Dolomites, an impressive deep view of the surrounding mountain valleys and not only, because on a sunny day you can recognize Venice, the main Alpine ridge with the Zugspitze and the Grossglockner, to name just a few well-known mountain peaks.</p>

						<h4>Alpe di Siusi</h4>
						<p>The holiday region of Alpe di Siusi in Italy is famous, not only because it has the largest alpine pasture in Europe, but also for its flora and fauna. Since 2009, the 57 km¬≤ alpine pasture, which stretches from 1,680 m to 2,350 m above sea level, east of Bolzano, has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>
